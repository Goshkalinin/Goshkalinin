## üöÄ Hello!
I'm Igor Kalinin, a junior Python developer, based in Yerevan. I'm currently honing my Python skills while also learning C/C++. My Python adventure began a couple of years ago when i started automating 3D modeling tasks.

I created Blender 3D scripts for batch transforming, rendering, and exporting 3D models. I also began working on scripts for generating math-based shapes.

Now, I'm writing things like Telegram bots, automating simple tasks, and more.
